            <p>
              Just as rockets launch <strong className="text-white">satellites</strong> into{" "}
              <em>space</em>, readiness rocket can launch{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">enterprises</strong> into a new space of GenAI.
            </p>

            <p>
              The important components of rockets are <em>payload</em>,{" "}
              <em>boosters</em>, and <em>launchpad</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Just as <strong className="text-white">payload</strong> carries satellite, the
              most critical component of the mission, payload of readiness rocket includes{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">GenAI maturity assessment</strong>,{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">scaled adoption strategy</strong>, and{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">readiness areas</strong> — the most critical
              components of operational readiness.
            </p>

            <p>
              Just as <strong className="text-white">boosters</strong> provide the necessary
              thrust to overcome earth's gravity and propel the rocket into space,{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">boosters of readiness rocket</strong> facilitate
              enterprises to escape the status quo and accelerate toward new realms of AI
              innovations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Just as <strong className="text-white">launchpad</strong> serves as the stable
              foundation for the rocket during preparation and liftoff, ensuring a safe and
              controlled launch, the launchpad of readiness rocket provides a strong
              foundation and support, helps mitigate risks and overcome issues, and ensures
              deliverables are achieved.
            </p>

            <p>
              Just as trajectory optimization enables rockets gain more speed through gravity
              turn, which involves using earth's rotation for a speed boost,{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">ecosystems</strong> enables scaled adoption of
              GenAI 3X faster by enabling collaboration between enterprises.
